## GIT TRAINING

* What is a SCM / VCS
* What is a DVCS: SQL database (CAP theorem), filesystem
* Origin of Git: Torvalds (Linux, filesystems...); BitKeeper (not free for kernel devs, etc)

* Commits: chain that points to the previous.
  - (This also of: linked lists)
  - There is a "root commit": just the fist commit you've made
* Commits: stagin area
	TODO
* Git objects:
  - blob: full files, not just delta. Faster on branching, saves ass sometimes.
  - tree: why can't commit an empty directory. Tree as collection of blobs.
  - commit: metadata of a tree. SHA1 identified and which data in them:
    - SHA1: what is an hash function?
	- inside the hash: date, author, committer, commit message, SHA1 or parent(s).
	- why author and committer? To merge from someone else (review).
  - tag: alias on SHA1

* Graph theory to undertstand Git
  - Commits create an acyclic directed graph
  - (Like a filesystem with symlinks)
  - Which command to...? Figure out what you want to do to the graph, translate into git terms, google.

* Branches:
  - Master is a branch like any other, just only conventional name
    - Same as SVN with trunk.
  - As it's a branch, it's just an alias to a commit (and its tree).
    - Any other branch would be the same
  - A merge commit it's a commit with more than 1 parent. The names of the branches are in metadata.
    - You can easily make branches of branches.
  - Deleting a branch: removes the alias/label. If the commits are not merged, can be GC'ed.
* Currently checked out branch: there is a symlink HEAD to the name of the branch.
  - Switching branch is as easy as chaning this symlink.
* Tags: a branch moves every commit, tags remain still.
  - We won't use tags. (or...? Discuss)

* GIT remotes
  - Protocols
    + HTTP (LDAP login)
    + SSH: key exchange supported
    + GIT own: nah, not on standard port.
    - Deployments are done with SSH and a readonly key login
  - Can have many remotes: one is usually called origin (the one you cloned from)
    - git remote add / rm
    - git remote -v
